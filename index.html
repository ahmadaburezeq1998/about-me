        <h1>welcome to my website !</h1>
     <div>
        <p id="welcome-p"> <br> I'm Ahmad aburezeq im 23,
            Born in jordan ,and i kive in amman . <br>
            i recently graduated from zaytoonah universit with a
             bachelor degree in Computer Science. <br>
             at uni i used to work as a salesman while studying .<br>
             at the moment Im taking a web development course at 
             ASAC and its good actually ,we have a lot of assignments 
             and labs which make it even harder so when i cant deal with 
             it anymore
             i would go out for a walk  or food trying to get my mind back
              to its normal 
             state .and for now i hope I can make it through this learning 
             experience since the learning in my universiy ty wasnt really a 
             good experience nor i had the expected output out of it.
